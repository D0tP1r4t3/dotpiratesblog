In the following example we are utilizing the xfreerdp3 tool which allows as to connect on RDP from linux.
This tool also provides the user with an option "+drive" where upon connecting on the target machine we can set a virtual drive which is visible,
as a map drive within explorer, allowing us to easily tranfer files from linux to windows using GUI.
