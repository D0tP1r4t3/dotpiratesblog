## My Journey
I’m not the best, and I’m definitely still learning. I recently earned my **OSCP** — after **five attempts**.  
Each failure shook my confidence, but I refused to quit. I studied harder, tried new approaches, and learned something valuable every time I fell short. That persistence eventually paid off.

I’ve been working as a **professional penetration tester** for the past **two years**.  
Before that, I completed my **BSc in Computer Networks & Cybersecurity** and my **MSc in Cybersecurity** in the UK.

## Life Before Cybersecurity
Before university, my path was completely different — I was a **professional basketball player** for 3–4 years and represented the **Cyprus National Team** from the age of 14 to 17. That experience taught me discipline, teamwork, and how to perform under pressure — skills that translate surprisingly well into hacking.

> Why I built this website

I’ve been inspired by many people in the cybersecurity space, especially those who encourage documenting your journey — whether through videos, blog posts, or any other format. The idea is simple: if you record your progress, you can look back and see how far you’ve come, while also proving to yourself (and others) that you’re actively learning, practicing, and improving.

For me, this site is exactly that — a personal record of my journey. Writing about the challenges I face, the machines I hack, and the concepts I study doesn’t just help me remember them; it forces me to understand them deeply enough to explain to someone else. Even if I get something wrong, that’s okay — the important thing is that I tried, and the next time, I’ll do better.

## Why I Share
Documenting my work keeps me accountable and motivated. When I revisit old writeups or notes, I can see my progress and feel encouraged to keep going. It also pushes me to develop skills outside of hacking — like building this website, organizing information, and improving my communication.

And there’s another big benefit: **connections**. By sharing my journey publicly, I’ve opened the door to meeting like-minded people, making new friends, and building a network in a community that thrives on sharing knowledge. Some of these connections lead to collaborations, mentorships, or even career opportunities — but more importantly, they create a sense of belonging.

## Time Is Precious
When working on a CTF machine or a penetration testing challenge, I could just solve it and move on — but I choose to multiply the value:

- Write a detailed blog post explaining my approach.
- Create a YouTube video walking through the process.
- Take private notes with commands, scripts, and lessons learned.

One machine then turns into multiple pieces of content, multiple opportunities to reinforce my skills, and multiple chances to help others. The extra effort pays off in skill retention, personal branding, and community impact.

## Giving Back
I’m not here to be famous or claim to be the best — I’m here to **get better**.  
If sharing my work helps even one person learn something new, get inspired, or start their own journey, then it’s worth it.

I’ve learned so much from the cybersecurity community, and this is my way of giving back — in my own words, at my own level, and with the mindset that **progress matters more than perfection**.
